# Mode selection depending on the bitcoin core network provided

Date: 2023-07-28

Status: proposed

## Context

bamotf is designed to run on all stages of the software development (local,
pre-production and production). The main idea is that devs can quickly prototype
something that receives bitcoin payments and rapidly make it to production. On
the version 0.0.1, as we needed to validate the interest around the tool so we
had cut some corners and one of those were the MODE. We needed a way to
represent those 3 scenarios and we chose to expose an ENV VAR for devs to select
the mode. This was a bad idea as it added another layer of complexity to the
initial setup, you could technically have a MODE=development with a production
bitcoin core, meaning you could theoretically enable the simulate payment
methods over a non valid network.

## Decision

First, remove the bitcoin core from the initial docker-compose.yml that devs use
to start the local bamotf. There's no apparent need for them to use bitcoin core
regtest locally since they only need to simulate that a payment was done, that
can be done bypassing the bitcoin core communication during development.
Maintain the bitcoin core regtest for bamotf team development and testing
purposes only.

Second, remove the MODE from the ENV VARS and instead allow users to set bitcoin
core connection strings for the testnet and for the mainnet, if the dev provide
those connections strings, the mode should be enabled for the user to select
them on the dashboard.

Third, add a new ENV VAR called `BAMOTF_DEVELOPMENT_ENABLED` that can be used to
enable the development mode... which enables the bypass of the bitcoin core.

## Consequences

1. Cost savings on the infrastructure (single instance)
2. Less complexity on the setup
