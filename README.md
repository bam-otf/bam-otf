# Bitcoin Payments Infrastructure

_Bitcoin Acknowledgement Mechanism Over Time Frame (bamotf)_ is a near
zero-config solution to accept bitcoins on your application. Designed
specifically for web developers, BAM makes it simple and easy to create payment
intents.

Forget about the need to dive deep into Bitcoin documentation or manage the
communication with the Bitcoin Core. BAM takes care of all of that for you.
There's no need to create and maintain a background service to check if
transactions have been completed - BAM notifies you via a webhook as soon as a
payment is confirmed on the blockchain.

In addition to its core functionality, BAM offers
[Node](./packages/node/README.md) and [React](./packages/react/README.md)
libraries, further easing implementation for developers.
