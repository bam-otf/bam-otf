# Welcome to Cashier

Cashier is a near zero-config Bitcoin payment processor that allows you to
accept Bitcoin payments in your app with just a few lines of code without having
to deal with the complexity of setting up a Bitcoin node, managing addresses,
and dealing with the Bitcoin network. It's built on top of the [Bitcoin
Core][bitcoin-core] and it's made for developers first.

## Packages

- **cashier-server** - A server that exposes a REST API to create and manage
  invoices.
- **[cashier-node](./packages/cashier-node/README.md)** - A Node.js client to
  interact with the Cashier server.

<!-- - **[cashier-react](./packages/cashier-react/README.md)** - A React component to
  easily integrate bitcoin payments in your React app. -->
