# Testing integration with fake Bitcoins

Given the nature of Bitcoin's scarcity. Testing your application can be
challening specially if you want to test it in the closest scenario to the
production as possible. This is why the Bitcoin core team have come up with the
`Testnet`, which is a network with the same rules as the actual Bitcoin network
but the coins have no value.

This guide will walk you through the process of testing bamotf with a testnet
wallet. This includes setting up the Bitcoin core over the testnet, configuring
bamotf, and setting up your testnet wallet.

## Setting up the Bitcoin Core over the Testnet

To set up the Bitcoin Core over the testnet, you will need to download and
install the Bitcoin Core on your server. You can find lots of guides on how to
do this online. This approach can be time-consuming and resource-intensive so it
can get expensive.

Optionally, you can use Docker to run the Bitcoin Core over the testnet on your
own machine or server using the `ruimarinho/bitcoin-core` Docker image. This is
a lightweight image that is easy to set up and use. You can find more
information about this image on its
[Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/ruimarinho/bitcoin-core). Or you can
use the following `docker-compose.yml` file to run the Bitcoin Core

```yml filename="docker-compose.yml" copy
version: '3.8'

services:
  bamotf: ...

  bitcoin-core-testnet:
    image: ruimarinho/bitcoin-core:latest
    command: [
        '-printtoconsole',
        '-testnet=1',
        '-prune=550',
        '-debug=http',
        '-rpcbind=0.0.0.0',
        '-rpcallowip=0.0.0.0/0',
        '-rpcuser=myrpcuser', # Replace with your own RPC username
        '-rpcpassword=myrpcpassword', # Replace with your own RPC password
      ]
    ports:
      - 18332:18332
    volumes:
      - ./docker-data/bitcoin:/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin
```

Be aware that this may take some time to download and sync the blockchain. You
can check the status of the blockchain sync by running the following command:

```bash copy
docker logs -f bitcoin-core-testnet
```

<Callout>
  If you prefer, you can [download the snapshot of the
  blockchain](https://bitcoin-snapshots.jaonoct.us/) and unpack it on the
  `./bitcoin/testnet3` folder to speed up the process.
</Callout>

## Configuring bamotf

To configure bamotf to use the Bitcoin Core over the testnet, you will need to
set the `TESTNET_BITCOIN_CORE_URL` environment variable to your bamotf server.
_This URL should include the user and password for the RPC connection_.

If you want to test it locally, you just need to set the
`TESTNET_BITCOIN_CORE_URL` environment variable on your docker-compose file.

```yml filename="docker-compose.yml" copy
version: '3.8'
services:
  bamotf:
    ...
    environment:
      ...
      - TESTNET_BITCOIN_CORE_URL=http://myrpcuser:myrpcpassword@bitcoin-core-testnet:18332

  bitcoin-core-testnet:
    ...
```

After that, you will need to create an [API Key](http://localhost:21000/apikeys)
and [Webhook](http://localhost:21000/apikeys) to your test environment and add
them to your application.

## Setting up Your Testnet Wallet

<Steps>
### Install the Blockstream's Green Wallet

Download and install the
[`Blockstream's Green Wallet`](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/green-bitcoin-wallet/id1402243590?l=en-GB)
on your phone.

### Create a Testnet Wallet

In order to create a testnet wallet, you first need to create a mainet wallet.
After creating the mainet wallet, head back to the list of wallets screen and
click on the `App Settings` button and turn on `Enable testnet` then, click on
`Save`.

After that just follow the normal "New Wallet" flow.

### Get Some Testnet Coins

Now that you have a testnet wallet, you need to get some testnet coins. Go to
one of the following testnet faucets and enter your testnet wallet address to
get some testnet coins:

- https://testnet-faucet.com/btc-testnet/
- https://tbtc.bitaps.com/
- https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co/
- https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/
- https://kuttler.eu/en/bitcoin/btc/faucet/
- https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/

Remember, the testnet network is separate from the main Bitcoin network. Coins
on the testnet have no real-world value and are useful for testing purposes
only.

</Steps>

## The `bamotf/core-dev` image

<Callout type="info">
  This is mainly used by the bamotf team to test the integration.
</Callout>

We also ship this `bamotf/core-dev` image which is a base image for building and
testing the Bitcoin core under the **regtest** network. During the
inicialization, it creates a `test-wallet` and mine 101 blocks to it so you can
start testing your application right away.

You probably don't need it but in case you do, you can access this image with
the following RPC access:

- user: `username`
- password: `wc7eFmVwEeZCDYTMaOqxRnLWSR7aI76bGmHl6pRFtAU`
