# Customizing the UI

Building the UI for bitcoin payments is not something challenging but it is
something time consuming. To solve that, we have built a set of
[React component library](../api/react) that you can use to build your own UI or
use a pre-built one. You can see all the components in action
[here](https://storybook.bamotf.com).

## Pre-built UI

The easiest way to get started is to use our pre-built UI. For that, you can
just use the `PaymentDetails` component. It will take care of everything for
you.

```tsx
import {PaymentDetails} from '@bamotf/react'

export default function PaymentPage() {
  return (
    // show a payment details for 10.00 BRL
    <PaymentDetails
      amount={0.00017}
      address="bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwfxxxx"
      label="Donation to bamotf"
      message="Thank you for your donation!"
    />
  )
}
```

But that component only shows the HTML markup, you'll still need to import the
CSS to format it.

```tsx {3}
import {PaymentDetails} from '@bamotf/react'

import '@bamotf/react/styles.css'

export default function PaymentPage() {
  return (
    // show a payment details for 10.00 BRL
    <PaymentDetails
      amount={0.00017}
      address="bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwfxxxx"
      label="Donation to bamotf"
      message="Thank you for your donation!"
    />
  )
}
```

the `@bamotf/react/styles.css` will import all the CSS needed format the
components but sometimes you don't want it to change any other style in the page
like when you already have Tailwind setup and working on your website. For that
reason, the `@bamotf/react/components.css` is also exported by the package. It
will only import the CSS needed for the components to work with the bareminimun
opnions styles. You'll need to add your own styles to make it look good.

```css filename="my-custom.css" copy
/* colors are in HSL format */
.payment-details {
  --foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;

  --card: 0 0% 100%;
  --card-foreground: 222.2 84% 4.9%;

  --border: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;
  --input: 214.3 31.8% 91.4%;

  --radius: 0.5rem;

  --success: 162 92% 44%;
}

.dark .payment-details {
  --foreground: 210 40% 98%;

  --card: 222.2 84% 4.9%;
  --card-foreground: 210 40% 98%;

  --border: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;
  --input: 217.2 32.6% 17.5%;

  --success: 160 96% 84%;
}
```

Then you can import them in your page.

```tsx {3,4}
import {PaymentDetails} from '@bamotf/react'

import './my-custom.css'
import '@bamotf/react/components.css'

export default function PaymentPage() {
  return (
    // show a payment details for 10.00 BRL
    <PaymentDetails
      amount={0.42}
      address="bc1qar0srrr7xfkvy5l643lydnw9re59gtzzwfxxxx"
      label="Donation to bamotf"
      message="Thank you for your donation!"
    />
  )
}
```

## Building your own UI

If you want to build your own UI, the `@bamotf/react` package also exports all
the components used by the pre-built. You can import them and use them in your
own page.

```tsx
import {QRCode, Copyable} from '@bamotf/react'

export default function PaymentPage() {
  return (
    ...
  )
}
```
