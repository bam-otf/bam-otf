# Webhooks

Listen incoming webhooks to get real-time updates. Bamotf uses webhooks to
notify your application when a certain event happens in your server. Webhooks
are particularly useful for asynchronous events like when a payment is confirmed
on the blockchain for example.

## How bamotf uses webhooks

A webhook enables bamotf to push real-time notifications to your app. The server
sends notifications to your app defined as `WEBHOOK_URL` in your docker as a
JSON payload. You can then use these notifications to execute actions in your
backend systems.

## Steps to receive webhooks

You can start receiving event notifications in your app using the steps in this
section:

1. Identify the events you want to monitor and the event payloads to parse.
2. Create a webhook endpoint as an HTTP endpoint (URL) on your local server.
3. Handle requests from bamotf by parsing each event object and returning 2xx
   response status codes.
4. Test that your webhook endpoint is working properly.
5. Deploy your webhook endpoint so it’s a publicly accessible HTTPS URL.
6. Set your publicly accessible HTTPS URL in the `WEBHOOK_URL` environment
   variable of the server with the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` that you are going to use to
   validate the requests.

## Validate requests

To make sure that the requests are coming from bamotf, you can validate the
requests using the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` that you have set in your server. You can
use the `bamotf.webhooks.constructEvent` method to validate the requests.

```ts filename="app/webhook/bamotf/route.ts" copy
import {bamotf} from '@/utils/bamotf'
import {NextResponse} from 'next/server'

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // TODO: add your secret here
  const secret = 'my-secret'

  const rawBody = await request.text()
  const signatureHeader = request.headers.get('x-webhook-signature') || ''

  const {success, parsed} = bamotf.webhooks.constructEvent(
    rawBody,
    signatureHeader,
    secret,
  )

  if (!success) {
    return NextResponse.json(
      {success: false, error: 'Invalid signature'},
      {status: 401, statusText: 'Unauthorized'},
    )
  }

  const {
    event,
    data: {paymentIntent},
  } = parsed

  switch (event) {
    case 'payment_intent.succeeded':
      // save this in your database
      // ...

      console.log(`✅ Payment intent succeeded: ${paymentIntent.id}`)
      return NextResponse.json({success: true})

    default:
      console.error(`Unknown event: ${event}`)
      return NextResponse.json({success: false, error: 'Unknown event'})
  }
}
```

All requests to the webhook endpoint are `POST` requests with a JSON payload in
the body. The payload contains the event data. The `x-webhook-signature` header
contains the signature for the request. The signature is computed using the
`WEBHOOK_SECRET` that you have set in your server.

If the signature is valid, the `bamotf.webhooks.constructEvent` method returns
an object with the following properties:

- `success` - `true` if the signature is valid, `false` otherwise.
- `parsed` - an object containing the event data.

## Test your webhook endpoint

You can test your webhook endpoint by sending a test webhook event to your
endpoint. You can do this by
[creating a test request](../reference/node#testing-webhook-signing). In
addition to that, you can also check the `Logs and events` on the payment intent
page of your server to see if the webhook event was received.

## List of webhook events available

- `payment_intent.processing` - Occurs whenever a new Transaction is detected on
  the Mempool.
- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Occurs when the sum of all transactions for a
  given PaymentIntent have reached the minimum confirmations.
