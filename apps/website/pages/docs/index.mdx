# Getting Started

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This is still a WIP. The API will probably change in the near future.
</Callout>

As of now, the best way to get started using bamotf is by following the Next.js
[Donation tutorial](./docs/tutorials/donation) which will guide you through the
whole process of:

1. Seting up the _development server_
2. Creating a new payment intent
3. Receiveing notifications from the server

To complement the tutorial, you can also check the
[API reference](./docs/reference)
