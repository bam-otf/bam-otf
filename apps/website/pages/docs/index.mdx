# Getting Started

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  **Breaking changes** - The project is a WIP and we're still exploring the
  design, so expect a lot of breaking changes. We try to document migration
  steps in [Releases](https://github.com/bamotf/bamotf/releases). Please [file
  an issue](https://github.com/bamotf/bamotf/issues/new) if any of these steps
  don't work.
</Callout>

As of now, the best way to get started using bamotf is by following the Next.js
[Donation tutorial](./docs/tutorials/donation) which will guide you through the
whole process of:

1. Seting up the _development server_
2. Creating a new payment intent
3. Receiveing notifications from the server

To complement the tutorial, you can also check the
[API reference](./docs/reference)
