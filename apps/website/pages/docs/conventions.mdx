# Conventions

## `MODE`

One hard concept for new web developers to grasp is the concept of having
differents networks that the application can run on. For them, mainnet, testnet,
regtest, are all the same thing. They are all just "the blockchain". But
technically, they are all different networks, with different rules, different
coins, different blockchains. Web developers are used to the concept of the
application is either running in production, or test (staging), or development.

This is why we have this `MODE` selector in the dashboard. It can be set to
`development`, `test` or `production`. This is used to determine certain
features that should or should not be enabled depending on the environment.

| Mode        | Network |
| ----------- | ------- |
| development | n/a     |
| test        | testnet |
| production  | mainnet |

## Price index

When creating a payment intentet in a Fiat currency, the amount is converted to
the corresponding amount in Bitcoin. This is done using a price index that is
available on Bisq servers `https://price.bisq.wiz.biz/getAllMarketPrices`. If
you don't like it, you can run your own price index server and set the
`PRICE_DATA_SERVER_CLEARNET_URL` environment variable to your own server.

## Tolerance

When creating a payment intentet in a Fiat currency, the amount is converted to
the corresponding amount in Bitcoin. But, because of the volatility of Bitcoin,
the amount can change between the time the payment intentet is created and the
time the payment is made. This is why we have a `tolerance` property. The
tolerance is a percentage of the amount that is allowed to be lost during the
exchange. If the amount changes more than the tolerance, the payment is
considered not valid.

## Amounts in bigint

All amounts are in `bigint`. This is because we don't want to deal with floating
point numbers rounding errors. This is why we have a `convertToBigInt` function
to convert a `number` to a `bigint`. [See more](./api/utils)
