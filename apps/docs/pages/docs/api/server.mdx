## Getting started

Follow [Running the Server](../#1-running-the-server) section in the main
README.

## Notes

- `tolerance` is a percentage of the `amount` that is allowed to be lost to
  during the payment process. Users might pay less than the `amount` due to
  exchange rate fluctuations or their wallet might be using a different price
  index than the one used by this server. For example, if `amount` is 100 USD
  and `tolerance` is 0.05, then the payment will be considered successful if the
  user pays between 95 and 100 USD given the price when the payment was sent to
  the mempool. _DEFAULT: 0.02 (2%)_

- `confirmations` is the number of confirmations required for the payment to be
  considered successful. Confirmations add up when blocks are added to the
  blockchain. _DEFAULT: 1_

- `currency` is the currency in which the `amount` is expressed. List of
  supported currencies can be found [here](./app/config/currency.ts). _DEFAULT:
  BTC_
