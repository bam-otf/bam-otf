# Creating payment Intents

Payment Intents are the recommended way to accept payments with bamotf. They
represent your customer's intent to pay you for goods or services and they are
confirmed once the payment is complete.

You can create payment intents by using the SDKs and libraries we provide or by
calling the API directly

## Creating a payment intent using libraries

To create a payment intent with the libraries, you need to call the `create`
method on the `PaymentIntent` class which may vary depending on the language
you're using. Here's an example:

<Tabs items={['javascript', 'typescript']}>
    <Tab>
    Make sure you have the **bamotf** Node library installed. See the [installation guide](/reference/node#installation) for more information.

    ```js
    import bamotf from 'bamotf'

    {/* FIXME: missing stuff */}
    const pi = await bamotf.paymentIntents.create({
            amount,
            address,
            currency: 'USD',
            confirmations: 6,
            description: 'Donation',
            tolerance: 0.02,
        })
    ```
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Creating a payment intent using the API

To create a payment intent with the API, you need to make a `POST` request to
the `/FIXME` endpoint. The request should include the following parameters:
{/* FIXME: Maybe add the link to the openapi specs */}

- `amount`: The amount of the payment intent in cents.
- `currency`: The currency of the payment intent. {/* FIXME: missing stuff */}
