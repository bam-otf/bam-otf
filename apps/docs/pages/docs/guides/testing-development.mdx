# Testing the bamotf integration

The bamotf server ships with a simulator screen that can be used to make test
payments when `MODE` is set to `development`.

### The `bamotf/core-dev` image

The suggested docker-compose also ships this `bamotf/core-dev` image which is a
base image for building and testing the Bitcoin core under the regtest Network.
During the inicialization, it creates a `test-wallet` and mine 101 blocks to it
so you can start testing your application right away.

You probably don't need it but in case you do, you can access this image with
the following RPC access:

- user: `username`
- password: `wc7eFmVwEeZCDYTMaOqxRnLWSR7aI76bGmHl6pRFtAU`
